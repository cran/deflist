Title: Deferred List - A Read-Only List-Like Object with Deferred
        Access
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Bradley", "Buchsbaum", email = "brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements the 'deflist' class, a read-only list-like object that accesses its elements via a function.
    The 'deflist' class can be used to model deferred access to data or computations by routing indexed list access to a function.
    This approach is particularly useful when sequential list-like access to data is required but holding all the data in memory at once is not feasible.
    The package also provides utilities for memoisation and caching to optimize access to frequently requested elements.
